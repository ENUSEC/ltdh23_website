        <p>We're so glad to be bringing back the Panel event again this year, as it has been very well received over the years it has ran; always bringing insightful questions and industry experience to the forefront. This year, we believe the panel topic of 'Neurodiversity in Cyber: Superpower vs. Kryptonite' is more relevant than ever, especially as neurodivergent individuals become recognised within the industry.</p>
        
        <blockquote>"About 15% to 20% of the world's population shows signs of neurodivergence" - Northwestern Medicine, 2025</blockquote>
        
        <p>In an industry that thrives on unconventional thinking, this is not just a statistic. It's a reminder of the incredible diversity of minds shaping cybersecurity. Whether you personally identify as neurodivergent or not, these conversations impact all of us. From recruitment and workplace culture to problem-solving approaches, understanding and embracing neurodiversity makes our community stronger.</p>
